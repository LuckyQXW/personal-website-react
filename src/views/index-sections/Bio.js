                                    Currently a Combined BS/MS Candidate studying Computer Science at the University of Washington-Seattle, 
                                    I enjoy building things and have involved in a wide range of projects including web development,
                                    data analysis, physical computing, robotics, game development, mobile interface design and app development.
                                    I like exploring the intersection of design and engineering, and human-computer
                                    interaction is an area that always fascinates me.

                                    Besides coding, I am also passionate about CS education and have been a math tutor since
                                    my freshman year of college for the University of Washington STARS Program, a engineering
                                    enrichment program designed for students from underserved backgrounds in engineering. Now
                                    I focus on being a teaching assistant for the intro programming courses, including CSE 143
                                    Computer Programming II with Java as the programming language. You are welcome to read more about my

                                    Currently, I am one of the head teaching assistants for CSE 163 Intermediate Data Programming,
                                    which teaches tools and libraries for data processing in Python. During the past spring break,
                                    I redesigned the whole interface of the course website for better usability and accessibility,
                                    and documented my process and learnings in <a href="https://medium.com/@wenqiu97/redesigning-the-course-website-in-one-week-day-0-7179ba2f2430" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a blog post series</a>.

                                    In my free time, I like to do digital sketches for video game characters. It is my go-to way of
                                    experiencing a sense of flow and sharpening my observation skills. You can check out most of my

                                    I also enjoy crocheting and creating my own sweaters and hats with colorful yarn ðŸ§¶.
